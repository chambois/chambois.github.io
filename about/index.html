  <p>Flow. That's how I came to programming. Getting into that state where
  time stops and the rest of the world disappears for a moment is my
  self-seeking passion. Empowering and helping others is my altruistic passion
  in programming and I'm grateful that I get to do them both.</p>

  <p>I love creating things and making things work. When I was young it was
  Lego, now it's making quality working software. It's an exciting job to have
  too with the anticipation of new technologies and how we might use them to
  change our lives for the better.</p>
