## Intro
* Where you set the scene and tell your readers everything they need to know to
understand why what you’re about to say is important
* spark interest
* where does the story start?

## Inciting incedent
* The question that your story is asking OR when the protagonist is faced with a
challenge

## Raise the stakes
* A series of moments that give weight and context to the inciting incident
(details).

## Main event
* inciting incident come to a head (aka the climax). This is either the answer
to the question we asked in the second beat or where the protagonist solves
his or her dilemma — a pivot or a change (even if it's just a shift in
attitude) should occur.

## Resolution
* highlight what makes the story unique. If you've just described a failure or
challenge, this would be the time to reflect on what you learned.
