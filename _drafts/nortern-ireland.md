There's a hefty bump and I awake with a start. Where am I? What's going on?
The propeller plane has just touched down on the runway, we've arrived in
Northern Ireland. A short one hour flight from Manchester. A smile to Arvind
and Mircea, we're at the start of our next adventure. 

A new land for us all to explore for the next three days. What are the
Northern Irish people like? What do they enjoy doing? What's their story?
What do they eat?  What does Guinness taste like? What the hell goes into an
Irish coffee anyway?

One night in Belfast, one night on the north coast in Castlerock, a rental
car, two-hundred and sixty odd miles of road and time to spend. Beyond a few
points of interest to see along the way that's the full extent of our plan.
Where shall this adventure lead us?

### Belfast
Exiting the George Best airport we're greeted with what feels like winter to a
Melbournian. Grey overcast skies, the temperature gauge struggling to push
into double digits, a drizzle and a breeze. The thought that the start of
summer is two weeks away seems bizarre. 

Making our way to our accommodation after getting off the bus we see catch our
first insight into the Northern Ireland story. The street we're walking down
is unlike any we've seen prior. The curbs are painted white, red and
blue. Union Jack flags are everywhere, off to the side streets some houses
even sporting multiple. We later discover we're in a unionist neighbourhood.
This is a Protestant area. We've all seen street art and graffiti before, but
this is different. Territorial markings in a suburb with a very clear message.
The tribal patterns of an ancient area appear here on the surface, contrasting
other relative cityscapes in their peaceful homogamy.

It feels rather empty for a Saturday morning, perhaps our Irish hosts are
recovering from the previous night? Or maybe they've decided to skip town
given the long weekend in search of brighter skies.

Waking up later than required after a heavy night drinking on the Friday, Rob 
missed his flight from Glasgow to Belfast. Still determined to join us, a
later flight would see him arrive later in the afternoon.  Arvind, Mircea
and myself had a few hours to spare after check-in, and after speaking to our
host Mark at the Global Village hostel, we made our way to a local Irish pub
for a feed. 

Upon walking in we wondered if we had the correct place. Walking straight
into the bar with its strong local feel, the promise from Mark that he would
give us our money back if we didn't enjoy it felt like we were about to get a
free meal. 

After perusing the menu our hopes lifted. There was too much to choose from
and it all looked too good. Needless to say two and a half hours, a few pints
of Guinness, three courses, and an Irish coffee to top it all off we couldn't
have asked for a more apt and delicious experience.

The precept of our Irish hosts to be warmly, welcoming and fierce drinkers
gave us the idea that the streets of Belfast would be a bustling scene come
nightfall on a Saturday. Walking the streets it was a different story. Not
many a soul in sight, it was a quiet non-disruptive affair. There didn't seem
to be a hint or a scent to follow to wherever the action was at. All we were
going on was a tip from our trusty host Mark for the best Guinness in town, to
be found at a bar called Kelly's. 

A few more empty streets later and empty expectations to match, we rounded a
corner to find our destination. History going back hundreds of years, Kelly's
seemed like a portal into another time and place. It was truly alive inside
compared to what seemed a wasteland beyond. So this is where our Irish friends
are at. The Guinness was a treat too, though the taste buds require some
adjustment yet to fully appreciate the subtlety of its reputation.

Main event
----------
* inciting incident come to a head (aka the climax). This is either the answer
to the question we asked in the second beat or where the protagonist solves
his or her dilemma â€” a pivot or a change (even if it's just a shift in
attitude) should occur.

Resolution
----------
* highlight what makes the story unique. If you've just described a failure or
challenge, this would be the time to reflect on what you learned.
