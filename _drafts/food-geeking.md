## Intro
* Where you set the scene and tell your readers everything they need to know to
understand why what you’re about to say is important
* spark interest
* where does the story start?

How are you tracking with your diet? If you're short of time and energy after the days
work I'm guessing you may be a little (or a lot) behind how you'd like to be
eating. There's so much being said of late on the benefits of healthy eating
and if you're reading this blog no doubt you're interested and have tried
various approaches. 

Unfortunately convenience food is usually far from what you should be eating in
terms of what your body really needs. 

- Tired of wasting food? Spending money on organic kale only to have to throw
  half of it out?

## Inciting incedent
* The question that your story is asking OR when the protagonist is faced with a
challenge

## Raise the stakes
* A series of moments that give weight and context to the inciting incident
(details).

## Main event
* inciting incident come to a head (aka the climax). This is either the answer
to the question we asked in the second beat or where the protagonist solves
his or her dilemma — a pivot or a change (even if it's just a shift in
attitude) should occur.

## Resolution

challenge, this would be the time to reflect on what you learned.
