        <title>Manchester, madchester, madferit and mad ferrets</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Rich in history, relaxed yet plenty on offer, populous but not crowded.
Manchester is proving a lovely place to live and explore. A modest front to a
deeper character, there seems much to learn, appreciate and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fancy a weekend away? There’s the entirety of Europe on your doorstep on
offer. Want to get out of the city and wander in the hills? Catch a train and
under an hour you’re amongst it. Want to explore the inner city? Check out the
bohemian Northern Quarter. Whatever it seems you feel like doing, there seems
to be the option to do it with relative ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather is reminiscent of my hometown of Melbourne. If you don’t like it,
just wait five minutes. It is a cooler temperament, one survives here without
the need for an air conditioner, the heat-waves of the summer don’t surpass
much beyond thirty degrees. With a higher rainfall average it’s also suited to
those who don’t mind the elements and enjoy sipping a hot coffee, cocoa or tea
whilst the rain dances. &lt;/p&gt;
